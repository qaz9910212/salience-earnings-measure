# salience-earnings-measure
A measure of salience earnings in behavioral finance categories 
The purpose of this program is to construct a salience measure for earnings per share (EPS) of 
publicly listed companies in the United States, based on the Salience theory and stock prices: Empirical evidence (2021).
The author intends to utilize this method to explain the phenomenon of earnings momentum. 
In comparison to the salience construction method for stock returns applied to rankings on monthly trading days, 
this method involves ranking EPS on a quarterly basis over a rolling 5-year period to construct the salience measure.
